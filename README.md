# nsqadmin_to_slack

`nsqadmin_to_slack` sends event actions from nsqadmin to a slack channel. It's inspired by [nsqadmin2hipchat](https://github.com/danielhfrank/nsqadmin2hipchat) by [@danielhfrank](https://github.com/danielhfrank).

This was adapted from a more generic internal nofication system in use at Bitly.

### nsqadmin configuration

`nsqadmin` supports creating a datastream of events of state change actions. These events cover actions like pause/unpause/empty/remove for topics and channels. 

To enable this event datastream configure `nsqadmin` to use the HTTP PUB endpoint on `nsqd`

```
nsqadmin --notification-http-endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=nsqadmin_events"
```

If HTTP requests to nqsadmin have a Basic authorization header (often from running behind an authenticating proxy like [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy)) that will be recorded in the event as the User initiating action. If the header X-Forwarded-Email is set, that will be used to match to the right slack user.

The structure of these events is defined [here](https://github.com/nsqio/nsq/blob/master/nsqadmin/notify.go#L12-L23).

### Configuration

`nsqadmin_to_slack` supports reading nsqadmin events from a nsqd topic, and sending properly formatted events to slack.
